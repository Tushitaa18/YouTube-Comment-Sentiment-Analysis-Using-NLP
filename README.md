# YouTube-Comment-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP

This project involved developing an NLP-based pipeline to analyze and classify YouTube comments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using TextBlob. By extracting data via the YouTube Data API, preprocessing text, and applying sentiment analysis techniques, the project provided insights into audience engagement and sentiment trends. Visualizations such as bar charts and word clouds were created to highlight key patterns, helping content creators better understand user feedback.
